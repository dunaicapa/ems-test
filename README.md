## Description:

This test is to find out more about your skills and capabilities to implement algorithms and to write
production code.

The program reads the currently reported problems (bugs) from an issue tracking system and calculates
the due date following the rules below:
---

- Working hours are 9AM to 5PM every working day (Monday through Friday)
- The program does not deal with holidays, which means that a holiday on a Thursday is still
considered as a working day by the program. Also a working Saturday will still be considered as
a nonworking day by the system.
- The turnaround time is given in working hours, which means for example that 2 days are 16
hours. As an example: if a problem was reported at 2:12PM on Tuesday then it is due by
2:12PM on Thursday.
- A problem can only be reported during working hours, which means that all submit date values
fall between 9AM and 5PM.
- Your task is to implement the CalculateDueDate method, which takes the submit date and
turnaround time as an input and returns the date and time when the issue is to be resolved.
- You may not use any third party libraries for date time calculations. (Eg.: Moment.js, Carbon,
Joda, etc.)

Pluses:

- Including automated test to your solution is a plus but not mandatory. Test driven (TDD)
solutions are especially welcome.
- Clean Code (by Robert. C. Martin) makes us happy.

Additional info:

- User interface is not required.
- You should use your favorite language.
- You shouldn’t write pseudo code. You should write code that you would commit/push to a repository and solves the given problem.
- You have net maximum 24 hours to submit your solution.
- You should submit even if you are not fully finished.
- If you have any further question, don’t hesitate to ask.
